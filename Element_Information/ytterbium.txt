In 1878 the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac separated from the rare earth erbia another independent component which he called ytterbia for Ytterby the village in Sweden near where he found the new component of erbium. He suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called ytterbium (in total four elements were named after the village the others being yttrium terbium and erbium). In 1907 the new earth lutecia was separated from ytterbia from which the element lutecium (now lutetium) was extracted by Georges Urbain Carl Auer von Welsbach and Charles James. After some discussion Marignacs name ytterbium was retained. A relatively pure sample of the metal was not obtained until 1953. At present ytterbium is mainly used as a dopant of stainless steel or active laser media and less often as a gamma ray source.
