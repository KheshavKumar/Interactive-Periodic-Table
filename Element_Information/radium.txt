Radium is a chemical element with the atomic number 88 and symbol Ra on the periodic table. It was discovered by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie in the form of radium chloride in 1898. It is an almost purewhite alkaline earth metal but when it is exposed to oxygen it turns black quickly. All isotopes of radium are radioactive and it glows faint blue because of this.
