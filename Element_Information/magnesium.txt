Magnesium ( mnizim magNEEzeem) is a chemical element with the symbol Mg atomic number 12 and common oxidation state 2. It is an alkaline earth metal and the eighth most abundant element in the Earths crust where it constitutes about 2 by mass and ninth in the known universe as a whole.5 This preponderance of magnesium is related to the fact that it is easily built up in supernova stars from a sequential addition of three helium nuclei to carbon (which in turn is made from three helium nuclei). Magnesium ions high solubility in water helps ensure that it is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater.6
