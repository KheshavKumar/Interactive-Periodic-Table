Zirconium is a lustrous greyishwhite soft ductile malleable metal that is solid at room temperature though it is hard and brittle at lesser purities.67 In powder form zirconium is highly flammable but the solid form is much less prone to ignition. Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis acids salt water and other agents.8 However it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid especially when fluorine is present.9 Alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than 35K.8
