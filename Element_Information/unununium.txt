Roentgenium is a chemical element with the symbol Rg and atomic number 111. It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. The most stable known isotope roentgenium282 has a halflife of 100 seconds although the unconfirmed roentgenium286 may have a longer halflife of about 10.7minutes.12 Roentgenium was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt Germany.
